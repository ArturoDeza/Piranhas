# Piranhas
A Toolkit for creating Peripheral Architectures

This toolkit was used to create the peripheral architectures of the paper "Can Peripheral Representations Improve Clutter Metrics on Complex Scenes?" by Arturo Deza & Miguel Eckstein, 2016.

The toolkit was originally written in MATLAB, but has been extended to python and Torch to increase cross-collaborations between fields of vision science and computer vision and deep learning. With recent trends in RNN's, and Attention-based Networks, we decided to make our toolkit public to stimulate 'hybrid' ideas in the general vision (human,computer,robot) community.

# What is a Peripheral Architecture?
A peripheral architecture is a collection of regions that simulate human-like pooling regions and foveal and peripheral like mechanisms. Peripheral Architectures can be simple such as the ones used in "Multiple Object Recognition with Visual Attention" [Ba,Mnih & Kavukucoglu, 2015], or can be more complex given biological constraints such as the one proposed in "Metamers of the Ventral Stream" [Freeman & Simoncelli, 2011]. 

# Creating Peripheral Architectures

1) Download our toolbox to create Peripheral Architectures at your convenience in MATLAB, python or Torch.
2) Define your viewing parameters.

	We will proceed with all the code from this point on in MATLAB, but it should be easily interpretable in the python/torch modules.
