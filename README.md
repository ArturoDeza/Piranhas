# Piranhas
A Toolkit for creating Peripheral Architectures

This toolkit was used to create the peripheral architectures of the paper "Can Peripheral Representations Improve Clutter Metrics on Complex Scenes?" by Arturo Deza & Miguel Eckstein, 2016.

The toolkit was originally written in MATLAB, but has been extended to python and Torch to increase cross-collaborations between fields of vision science and computer vision and deep learning. With recent trends in RNN's, and Attention-based Networks, we decided to make our toolkit public to stimulate 'hybrid' ideas in the general vision (human,computer,robot) community.

# What is a Peripheral Architecture?
A peripheral architecture is a collection of regions that simulate human-like pooling regions and foveal and peripheral like mechanisms. Peripheral Architectures can be simple such as the ones used in Multiple Object Recognition with Visual Attention [Ba,Mnih & Kavukucoglu, 2015]
